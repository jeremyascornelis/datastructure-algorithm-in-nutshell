ALgorithm
A set of steps or instructions for completing a task.
Ex: A recipe is an algorithm, your morning routine is also an algorithm.

Algorithm in programming context means
A set of steps a program takes to finish a task.

Learning about algorithms gives you deeper understanding about complexity and eficiency in programming.

Guidelines about algorithm:
- Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output
- The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order
- The steps also need to be distinct (you should not be able to break it down into further subtask)
- The algorithm should produce a result
- The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time
